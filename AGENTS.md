# Contribution Guide

## Project Overview

This project aims at a minimalistic front-end only website that is served via
Github pages as a static site. This site is simply a platform to create and
share cost splitting for groups of people with complicated transaction splits
and requirements. Due to the simplistic nature of this work, everything is done
in native HTML + JavaScript + CSS. Node is only a requirement for development
purposes (linting, formatting, testing).

## Code Best Practices

1. Document all non-trivial functions with JSDoc format
2. Prioritize separation of roles and consistent style
3. Do not change state structure unless absolutely necessary
