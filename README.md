# Cost Split Calculator

A minimal front-end application for splitting costs between people. The state of the calculator can now be shared via URL parameters.

## Sharing

The current state is reflected in a read-only field in the Share section. Copy this link to share with others. When visiting a link containing a `state` query parameter, the page will automatically load that state.
